# Week 18 Homework Assignment - All the News That's Fit to Scrape
# Flexing my Mongoose and Cheerio muscles by scraping news from another site

### Overview

In this assignment I have create a web app that lets users leave comments on the latest news. But the articles were web scraped using Mongoose and Cheerio muscles.

## Application Overview

  1. Whenever a user visits your site, the app will scrape stories from a news outlet. The data should at least include a link to the story and a headline, but feel free to add more content to your database (photos, bylines, and so on).
  2. Use Cheerio to grab the site content and Mongoose to save it to your MongoDB database. 

  3. All users can leave comments on the stories you collect. They should also be allowed to delete whatever comments they want removed. All stored comments should be visible to every user.
  4. You'll need to use Mongoose's model system to associate comments with particular articles. 

### One Last Thing

**Wish me Good Luck!**
